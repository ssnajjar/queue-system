Saleem - I created a boiler plate for the APP. Installed express for the backend and nodemon. We will not need this for now as for assignment 2 we only need front end implementation.

There is a client folder (contains our frontend) made with vite-react-javascript

To run the front end run these commands:

cd client

npm -i

npm run dev

To run the backend run these commands:

cd server

npm -i

npm run dev
